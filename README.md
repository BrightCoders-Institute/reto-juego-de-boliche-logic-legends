- Clone the repository or download the source code files.
- Make sure you have TypeScript installed globally on your machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Run the command tsc to compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript.
- After successful compilation, you can run the game using Node.js by executing the command `node dist/index.js`.
